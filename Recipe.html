                    <p> <img src="images/number1.png" class="n1" alt="number1">
                        <br> Roast the chiles over an open flame until the skins are mostly blackened. (I set mine on my stove's burner over a medium-low flame, and turn them occasionally with tongs.) Set aside until cool enough to handle, then peel, seed, and chop the chiles.</p>
                    <p>
                        <p> <img src="images/number2.png" class="n1" alt="number2">
                            <br> Separate the stems from the cilantro leaves and reserve both. Chop the stems and place them with the chiles and zucchini. Reserve the leaves in a separate bowl.</p>
                        <p> <img src="images/number3.png" class="n1" alt="number3">
                            <br>Warm the oil over medium heat in a large saucepan or soup pot. </p>
                        <p> <img src="images/number4.png" class="n1" alt="number4">
                            <br>Add the onion and saute until slightly translucent, 5 minutes. Add the chile, cilantro stems, zucchini, parsley, mint and salt. </p>
                        <p> <img src="images/number5.png" class="n1" alt="number5">
                            <br>Cook, stirring occasionally, until the zucchini is fairly soft, 5-10 minutes. </p>
                        <p> <img src="images/number6.png" class="n1" alt="number6">
                            <br>Add the tortilla and enough water or stock to come up to the level of the vegetables. </p>
                        <p> <img src="images/number7.png" class="n1" alt="number7">
                            <br>Increase the heat and bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer the soup, partially covered, until the zucchini is very soft, about 15 minutes.</p>
                        <p> <img src="images/number8.png" class="n1" alt="number8">
                            <br>Let the soup cool slightly. </p>
                        <p> <img src="images/number9.png" class="n1" alt="number9">
                            <br>Reserve a few pretty sprigs of cilantro for garnish, and add the rest to the soup. </p>
                        <p> <img src="images/number10.png" class="n1" alt="number10">
                            <br>Use an immersion blender to puree the soup completely smooth. (Alternately, puree the soup in a blender in two batches.) </p>
                        <p> <img src="images/number11.png" class="n1" alt="number1">
                            <br>Add the lime juice to taste, and more salt if needed. If the soup is thick, thin it with a bit more water or stock; if the soup is too thin, you can add more tortilla, simmer for 5 minutes to soften, and puree again.</p>


                        <p class="title">Make the totopos:</p>
                        Heat the remaining oil in a heavy (such as cast iron), medium skillet set over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Add the tortilla strips, and saute, flipping and stirring frequently with a metal spatula, until the tortillas are golden and crisp, reducing the heat if needed. Season with a pinch of salt.
                        <br> Serve the soup warm, garnished with a dollop of cream, a handful of tortilla strips, and leaf or two of cilantro and mint.
